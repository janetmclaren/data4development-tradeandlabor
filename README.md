2. From this OSF database, download:
    - "Data Module, V3_Manuscript Only_210420.DOCX or .PDF"
    - "CountryRegion_ILO_210419.csv"
    - "InfEmp_ILO_210419.csv"
    - “Decent Work Workbook_210420.twbx”
3. Open the "Data Module" file and follow the instructions to complete the data module assignment.

Good Luck!
